        <h3>The Journey of a Full-Stack Developer: Embracing Both Frontend and Backend</h3>
        <p>In today's fast-paced tech industry, the role of a full-stack developer has become one of the most sought-after careers. As a full-stack developer myself, I’ve come to appreciate the unique challenges and opportunities that come with working on both the frontend and backend of web applications. It's a rewarding journey that allows you to create fully functional websites and apps, from the user interface to the underlying server-side logic.</p>
        <h3>What is Full-Stack Development?</h3>
        <p>Full-stack development involves working with both the frontend and backend parts of a web application. The frontend refers to the parts of a website or app that users interact with directly—think of the layout, design, and user experience. The backend, on the other hand, is responsible for handling data storage, server-side logic, and database management.</p>
